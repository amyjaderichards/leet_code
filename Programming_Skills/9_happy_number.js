/*
Write an algorithm to determine if a number n is happy.

A happy number is a number defined by the following process:

Starting with any positive integer, replace the number by the sum of the squares of its digits.
Repeat the process until the number equals 1 (where it will stay), or it loops endlessly in a 
cycle which does not include 1.
Those numbers for which this process ends in 1 are happy.
Return true if n is a happy number, and false if not.

Input: n = 19
Output: true
Explanation:
12 + 92 = 82
82 + 22 = 68
62 + 82 = 100
12 + 02 + 02 = 1

 var isHappy = function(n) {
    let result = n;
    const visited = {};
    const getDigits = number => `${number}`.split('').map(str => Number(str));
    
    // escape loop if result is 1
    while (result !== 1) {
        let digits = getDigits(result);
        result = digits.reduce((acc, curr) => acc + Math.pow(curr, 2), 0);
        
        // memorized visited results, it's not a happy number when revisit occurs
        if (visited[result] === undefined) {
            visited[result] = true;

            return false
